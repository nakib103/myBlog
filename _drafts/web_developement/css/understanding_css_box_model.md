### What is CSS Box Model
Box model is key to understand how we can style HTML elements and create complex layouts for our websites. We can think of each HTML element as a box with certain width and height. The box have a `border` and the `content` of the element reside within the border. We can use `padding` to create distance between the border and and the content. Lastly there is `margin` that can create distance among different elements. As, you might have already inderstood, a CSS box consists of 4 things - 
- content
- padding
- border
- margin
