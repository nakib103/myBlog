## What is HTML
HTML is a markup language for websites. Markup languages are a type of text-encoding system that tells the structure and formatting of a document. Web browser can parse these documents and render accordingly. It is a hypertext because it can caontains hyperlinks that references to other text and media such as images, audio, and video. 

- <b>file extension:</b> .html or .htm
- <b>case-sensitive:</b> no

## Basics

HTML document consists of elements which makes different parts of the rendered web page. Each element have a start tag and end tag with the content of the element confined within these two tags. Each element can also have different attributes which provides additional information about the element.

### Elements

HTML element consists of -
- start tag -
- content - 
- end tag - 

For example, look at a paragraph element - 
![html element]({{ site.baseurl }}/_images/html_element.png)

### Attributes

An HTML attribute consists of -
- name - 
- value - enclosed by double quotation? multiple values separated by space? 

<b>Attributes are always written in the start tag of an element.</b>

For example, a paragraph element can have `style` attribute with value `color: red` to say render the text in red. 
![html element]({{ site.baseurl }}/_images/html_attribute.png)

### Docuement Structure
{% highlight HTML %}
<html>

<head> Meta data about the HTML document</head>

<body> Document content </body>

</html>
{% endhighlight %}

### Execution Process

HTML page is parsed sequentially from beginning to end. As resources are encountered like image and stylesheets browser executes parallel request for them. But if script tag is found they are loaded and executed first before proceeding. Exception is script tag with attribute `defer` or `sync`. Browser may however sometimes look-ahead and request another script tag execution in parallel with current script tag running.

## Elements and Attributes

An element is defined by a <start tag>, then some content, then </end tag>. An empty element is that does not have any content.

All HTML elements can have attributes and provide additional information about the element. Attributes are always specified in the start tag. Attributes usually come in name-value pairs like: name="value".

### Web App Manifests

Part of collection of technologies called Progressive Web Apps (PWA). They are websites that can be installed in devices home screen without an appstore. The web app manifest provides information about a web application in a json text file, necessary for the web app to be downloaded and be presented to the user similarly to a native app (e.g., be installed on the home screen of a device, providing users with quicker access and a richer experience).

{% highlight HTML %}
<link rel="manifest" href=/temp.webmanifest>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight JSON %}
// temp.webmanifest file (json format)
{
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": 
      "sizes": 
      "type":
    },
    ...
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Web Feeds

Web site visitor can subscribe to the feeds provided in the website. The updated contents are send to 'feed readers'. In this way they can stay updated about the content of the page even if they do not visit the website.

{% highlight HTML %}
<link rel="feed" href="/temp.xml" type="application/rss+xml">
{% endhighlight %}

### Twitter Cards
If you use twitter cards in your website if someone shares content of your site on twitter it will show a card with a preview.
