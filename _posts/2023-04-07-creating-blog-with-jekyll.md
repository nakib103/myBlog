Jekyll is a powerful tool that can create a static website based on the content you write in some markdown or html text. It also provide useful utilities to create blogs. This blog for one is powered by Jekyll and I am going to talk about how you can make one too.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
